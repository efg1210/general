            <p>Spanish 1 was a class so that everyone in the UCVTS district was on the same level with their Spanish knowledge coming in.  This way, if someone did not know any Spanish or very little, they could take this class and get caught up and learn the basics of the language.  This class was difficult since I did not know much Spanish coming in.  </p>

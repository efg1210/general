            <p>Fitness and Health was a different class from the traditional gym class at a high school.  In the first part of the year, we did fitness, which is similar to what an adult would do in a gym.  Then we had health, then Project Adventure.  In this we did team building activities and climbed ropes.  Lastly we did sports, where we play a sport.  It was ultimate frisbee last year.  </p>

            <p>This is an essay for English class, completed December 6th, 2016.  We were to write an essay about how Okonkwo, the main character in <i>Things Fall Apart</i> by Chinua Achebe, was a victim of his virtues.  I selected this artifact because I did well on it.  It was well written, and I explained my thoughts clearly.  I learned the how helpful teacher feedback could be when writing this essay, and I am thankful my teacher, Ms. Burke, looked over parts of it and helped my condense my (obviously) verbose writing.  This essay shows my skills in essay writing, part of the reason I selected it.  If I could do something differently, it would be to make sure the whole thing is written in the past tense.  If I had done that, I would have lost only half of what I did lose.  </p>

            <p>This brochure was a project that describes a job, which in my case was software development.  The project was to inform and convince people to want that job.  This was done for Computer Applications in Business (CAB), and was completed September 23rd, 2016.  I selected this artifact because, as a 15 year-old, there was very little I could possibly include in my career part of this portfolio.  Frankly, I am not sure if I even want to have this job in the future.  I want to primarily be an author as my career, and to go into some IT field to make money.  I picked some IT field because I knew I liked computers and coding, but I still would like to become an author.  While I still do not know what IT field I would like to go into, software development does sound like a good idea, since It makes a significant amount of money and they design software, which sounds fun.  </p>

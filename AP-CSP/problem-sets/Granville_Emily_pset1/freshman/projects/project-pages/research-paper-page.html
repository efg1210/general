            <p>This is a research paper done in English class, completed April 18th, 2017.  We were to select a topic (not in the USA or in England) and research.  I felt I needed to research something important, so I selected acid attacks in India.  I selected this artifact because I felt I did well on it.  I worked really hard to make this research paper the best it could be, and I think I did that.  I learned that making a works cited page is not nearly as daunting as one may think.  I also learned that writing a research paper is quite difficult, but worth it if you try hard and pick an important subject.  This paper shows my ability to write well, and if I do become an author one day, writing well is a bit important.  If I could do something differently, I would have procrastinated far less, since I waited until the day before it was due with some parts of the paper.   </p>

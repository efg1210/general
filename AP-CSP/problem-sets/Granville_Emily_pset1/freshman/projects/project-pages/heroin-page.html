            <p>This project was to describe a drug assigned to our group, including its effects, legal status, and punishments if illegal.  Then we had to explain it to our class.  My group was assigned heroin.  It was completed November 21st, 2016 for Health class.  I selected this because it was one of very few projects done for Health, and it was the nicest one.  Some of the research was hard to find, and the project was also difficult as some of my group had a hard time concentrating on doing their work.  I learned, for the first time, how important it was for everyone in their group to do their work, since it may mess everyone else up.  It shows my ability to research and understand laws, and also my ability to speak in public.  If I could do something different, I would have my group work harder.  </p>

            <p>This is a drawing of organelles for Biology class.  I selected this artifact because I tried hard on it and it looks really nice.  While this took a long time to do, I am glad I spent the time to make it well.  Well technically I did the assignment wrong (it was supposed to be inside an actual cell), I drew the various organelles well enough that I received full credit.  I learned from this that if you misunderstand what you are supposed to do, but do well anyway, you may still get full credit.  This shows my hard work (it took forever to do) and art skills (I mean, look at it).  Even though I misunderstood the assignment, I would not have done this differently because I am so pleased with the outcome.  </p>

            <p>This is the script of a presentation I did in Spanish class.  We were to write everything about our family, gather pictures of our family, and present our script and pictures.  It was completed March 3rd, 2017.  Spanish is easily my worst subject, so writing this script was hard.  Presenting the script, however, was far harder.  I often get nervous when speaking in another language, since I feel I will make a foolish mistake.  While presenting the script was not graded, I feel I did well on it.  I also feel my script was, overall, well written.  I am quite proud on how I did on this project, and it showed me how well I could do if I tried really hard and practiced a lot.  </p>

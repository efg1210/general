            <p>This was a lab report concerning the acidity of various solutions to clean pennies.  The goal was to see what acidity worked best in removing the oxidized copper from the penny.  This was for Science Inquiry and Analysis (SIA), and was completed October 6th, 2016.  I selected this because it was a lab report that I did well on.  It shows my ability to collect data and analyze it to draw a conclusion.  In addition, I did not procrastinate on this, and I am quite proud of that fact.  </p>

            <p>This project was what the social media page of Frederick the Great would look like.  It was for History class, and it was completed November 15th.  I selected this artifact because, frankly, it looks very nice.  While that sounds a bit shallow, I can assure you it is not.  Making this project look pretty took a very long time, and the entire project took hours.  I worked very hard, and I got a good grade as a result.  </p>

            <p>In World History we learned about the history from the Renaissance to nearly present day.  It was really fun to learn about, but also just as informational.  We also did many projects, one of which is displayed below.  It was a lot of work, but it was worth learning so much.  </p>

                <li>This project was what the social media page of Frederick the Great would look like.</li>

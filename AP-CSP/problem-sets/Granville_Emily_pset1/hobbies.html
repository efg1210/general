            <h2 class="hobby-body">Coding Club</h2>
            <p class="hobby-body">Last year I was in Coding Club and I am very excited to be a part of it again.  It is a great place to be with friends and it is an amazing environment.  Help is always provided if needed, and it is very wonderful all around.  This year I hope to be more involved.  Maybe I can even teach HTML!  The Coding Club page can be found <a href="https://www.ucvts.tec.nj.us/Domain/789" target="_blank">here</a>.  </p>
            <img alt="Relay for Life logo" class="hobby-body  hobby-pic" src="images/relay-for-life-logo.png"/>
            <h2 class="hobby-body">Relay for Life</h2>
            <p class="hobby-body">Last year I joined Relay for Life, which is a club where money is raised for cancer victims and research.  Last year I was just a member on a team, but as of this year I want to be a captain.  I am excited to run things myself and be in charge, though I expect it to be difficult.  The Relay for Life page for AIT and UCTech can be found <a href="https://www.ucvts.tec.nj.us/Domain/680" target="_blank">here</a> and the donation page can be found <a href="http://main.acsevents.org/site/TR?pg=entry&fr_id=86043" target="_blank">here.  </a></p>

            <h2 class="hobby-body">Robotics</h2>
            <p class="hobby-body">As of this year, I have joined the UCVTS Robotics Club.  So far it is a fun way to hang out with my current friends, reconnect with old ones, and make new friends!  I am very excited for what will hopefully be a fun year in Robotics Club!  The Robotics Club page can be found <a href="http://team1257.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.  </p>

            <h2 class="hobby-body">Student Leadership Council</h2>
            <p class="hobby-body">The Student Leadership Council is a group of students in AIT who have shown leadership either by being elected as a Class Officer, by being elected in Student Government, or by earning Student of the Month.  I am in it through Student of the Month, and it is a new program as of the 2017-2018 school year, and it is to help the students communicate with Ms. Gianella and the other people in charge of AIT.  </p>

            <h2 class="hobby-body">Reading</h2>
            <p class="hobby-body">Reading is my main hobby!  I really love it, and it helps me relax after stressful days.  I don't know what I would do without it!</p>
            <img alt="A picture of a flower" class="hobby-body hobby-pic" src="images/flower.png"/>
            <h2 class="hobby-body">Photography</h2>
            <p class="hobby-body">Photography is another one of my hobbies!  I usually take pictures of plants, though sometimes I take pictures of other things too.  The picture to the right is a picture I took myself, and I can't wait for the fall leaves to show so I can take pictures of them too.  </p>

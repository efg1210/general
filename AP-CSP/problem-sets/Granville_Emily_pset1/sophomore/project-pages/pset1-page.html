            <p>This project is to make a website that shows my high school career so far.  This project is actually this website, and I may be breaking the fourth wall by writing this.  That was why the link above just brings you to this website again, and why the preview is the home page of this website.  To see more of this project you can delete the new tab and continue here, or play around on the other tab.  Either way just know I coded everything (though I did have some help from Mr. Wilson, thank you!).  This project was hard, very time consuming, but very fun to do.  Next time I will procrastinate less.  </p>

            <p>Fitness and Health is a different class from the traditional gym class at a high school.  In the first part of the year, we are doing fitness, which is similar to what an adult would do in a gym.  Then we will have Project Adventure, where we will do team building activities and climb ropes.  Then we will have health, which will be doing character building.  Lastly we sports, where we play a sport.  It will be volleyball this year.  </p>

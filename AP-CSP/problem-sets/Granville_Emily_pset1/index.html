                <p id="about-me">Hello!  I am Emily Granville.  I am currently a 15-year-old sophomore at the Academy for Information Technology (AIT).  I love to read most of all, but I also like coding, writing, drawing, and photography.  I really love Harry Potter (go Ravenclaw!) and I love watching Doctor Who (but I haven't watched too many-- don't spoil it!).  I have the most amazing family and friends, and I don't know what I would do without them.  Click around to learn more about my high school career!  </p>
